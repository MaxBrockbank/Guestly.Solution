# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description



## MVP User Stories?
### Have a queryable database of guests with full CRUD funcationality.

1. As a hotel employee, I need to be able to see a list of all guests that have stayed at my hotel.

2. As a hotel employee, I need to be able to see a record of which rooms a guest has stayed in. (I.E. Sarah Johnson stayed in room 207, room 319, and room 500.)

3. As a hotel employee, I need to be able to track the revenue earned from an individual guest.

4. As a hotel employee, I need to be able to search/query my list of guests in order to search by revenue earned, most nights stayed, etc.

5. As a hotel employee, I need to be able to see a details page of each individual guest, where information such as contact info can be viewed.

6. As a hotel employee, I need to be able to search for guests, rooms, and ____________?

## Stretch Goals?

1. As a hotel employee, I would like to be able to see a details page for hotel rooms and properties (to include a list of guests that have stayed in them).

2. As a hotel employee, I would like if revenue tracking was presented in an easy-to-digest interface (charts, graphs, etc).

3. User Roles - Admin can message application users. [define more roles?] harcode user roles?

4. JS front end - adding interactivity with nav bar, etc. 

5. Handle Identity Errors
